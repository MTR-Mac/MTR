## What is MTR?  

MTR for Mac is a compact, command-line network diagnostic tool that blends the continuous probing of ping with the path-tracing of traceroute into a single live display. Instead of producing a single static snapshot, MTR continuously updates the route, latency, and packet-loss statistics for each hop along the path to a destination, giving you an evolving view of network health. This makes it ideal for uncovering intermittent issues, transient congestion, and persistent bottlenecks that one-off tests can miss.

The utility is widely used by network engineers, sysadmins, and support technicians who need accurate, up-to-the-second information about how packets traverse networks. MTR shows which hops introduce latency or drop packets, so you can quickly determine whether a problem lies with the local LAN, the ISP, or a remote segment. Because it presents data in a concise table that refreshes live, it is exceptionally useful in on-the-fly troubleshooting and in situations where network conditions change rapidly.

MTR is lightweight and scriptable, allowing you to log sessions, parse results, or integrate it into monitoring systems and runbooks. It supports IPv4 and IPv6, works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, and can be combined with other tools for deeper analysis. For administrators who must diagnose slow connections, packet loss during peak hours, or route asymmetries between data centers, MTR provides an essential, time-saving view into real network behavior.
